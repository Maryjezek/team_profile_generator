The application must have these classes: Employee, Manager, Engineer, and Intern. The tests for these classes (in the _tests_ directory) must all pass.

The first class is an Employee parent class with the following properties and methods:

name

id

email

getName()

getId()

getEmail()

getRole() // Returns 'Employee'

The other three classes will extend Employee.

In addition to Employee's properties and methods, Manager will also have:

officeNumber

getRole() // Overridden to return 'Manager'

In addition to Employee's properties and methods, Engineer will also have:

github // GitHub username

getGithub()

getRole() // Overridden to return 'Engineer'

In addition to Employee's properties and methods, Intern will also have:

school

getSchool()

getRole() // Overridden to return 'Intern'

Finally, although itâ€™s not a requirement, you should consider adding validation to ensure that user input provided is in the proper expected format.
